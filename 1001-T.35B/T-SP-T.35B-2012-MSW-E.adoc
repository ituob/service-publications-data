== Note from TSB:

ITU-T Recommendation T.35 provides a mechanism for the inclusion of non-standard facilities, which are used in several protocols defined in ITU-T Recommendations. This mechanism uses three types of codes: (a) a country code, (b) a terminal provider code (also known as manufacturer code), and (c) a terminal provider oriented code. The ITU-T Recommendation T.35 country codes are defined within this Recommendation and the terminal provider oriented codes are defined by the manufacturer. However, for the manufacturer code, ITU-T Recommendation T.35 states: "An Administration, or a national body designated by an Administration, has the responsibility for the allocation and management of the terminal provider code".

In order to provide a centralized list of national authorities for the assignment of ITU-T T.35 terminal provider codes, and to assist manufacturers in obtaining such codes, ITU-T Recommendation T.35 further states: "When an Administration designates a national body, its address and name should be sent to the Director of TSB." 

A list of national authorities for the assignment of ITU-T Recommendation T.35 terminal provider codes has been set up.. 

Any new or updated information on the identity of the current national authority designated by each Administration for the assignment of the ITU-T Recommendation T.35 terminal provider codes should be communicated to TSB, to the E-mail: mailto:tsbtson@itu.int[tsbtson@itu.int], Fax: +41 22 730 5853 by using the http://www.itu.int/ITU-T/inr/forms/files/T35-form-en.doc[Notification Form].

The designations employed and the presentation of material in this List do not imply the expression of any opinion whatsoever on the part of ITU concerning the legal status of any country or geographical area, or of its authorities.
