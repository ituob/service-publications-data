== Note from the BR

In the Circular Letter CR/430 of 14 May 2018, the Radiocommunication Bureau requested administrations to advise the Union on their current position with respect to provision No. 25.1 of the Radio Regulations, concerning radiocommunications between stations of their Amateur Service and Amateur-Satellite Service and those of different countries. The Circular Letter also stated that in cases where no information was received from an administration, it shall be assumed that the concerned administration has no objection to such radiocommunications. 

In the same Circular Letter, administrations were requested further to advise the Bureau of the form of call signs they assigned their amateur and experimental stations. 

This Annex to the Operational Bulletin No. 1154 dated 15 August 2018 cancels and supersedes the previous Annex to the Operational Bulletin No. 1055 dated 1 July 2014. The Annex takes into account information received from administrations with respect to provision No. 25.1 of the Radio Regulations. As it concerns the form of call signs assigned to amateur and experimental stations, where no new information has been received from an administration, information currently held in the relevant registries of the Bureau is reproduced. 

This Annex will be updated by numbered series of amendments published in the ITU Operational Bulletin. Furthermore, the information contained in this Annex is also available on the ITU home page http://www.itu.int/pub/T-SP/e[http://www.itu.int/pub/T-SP/e] and can be consulted by subscribers by remote access. 

Administrations are requested to check the accuracy of the information published herein and to inform the Union of any discrepancies. Changes to the information provided should be notified to the Bureau as soon as possible.
