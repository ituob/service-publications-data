== Note by TSB

[class=steps]

. The List of various tones used in national networks has now been updated by amendments published in ITU Operational Bulletin..

. Administrations are reminded of the advantages of standardizing audible tones as far as possible so that subscribers and operators may quickly recognize any tone transmitted of whatever origin.

. In order to have current information and to keep the List up-to-date, Administrations are strongly requested to submit a concise technical description of any new or changed network tones to the ITU/TSB whenever such tones are introduced, by using the attached Notification form.

. For your information, this list will be updated by numbered series of amendments published in the ITU Operational Bulletin. Furthermore, the information contained in this Annex is also available on the ITU web page http://www.itu.int/itu-t/bulletin/annex.html[www.itu.int/itu-t/bulletin/annex.html] .
